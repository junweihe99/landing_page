# landing_page
Landing page is a recreation of a typical website homepage. The overall structure of the website was set up using HTML and then styled using CSS.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
The main challenge for this project was learning to implement CSS flexbox to recreate the desired webpage structure. After properly comprehending how flexbox worked, recreating the webpage was a breeze.

<h4>Improvements to Add</h4>
The project was designed and implemented while I was working at at 50% screen capacity; therefore, at full-screen the webpage looks stretched. In the future, I will restyle the webpage to be more dynamic.
