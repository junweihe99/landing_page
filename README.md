    <li>Quote section
    <li>Advertisement section
    <li>Footer section

<h4>Challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The main challenge for this project was learning to implement CSS flexbox to recreate the desired webpage structure. After properly comprehending how flexbox worked, recreating the webpage was a breeze.
  </ul>

<h4>Improvements to Add</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The project was designed and implemented while I was working at at 50% screen capacity; therefore, at full-screen the webpage looks stretched. In the future, I will restyle the webpage to be more dynamic.
    <li>Personalize the website
    <li>Add interactivity
  </ul>
